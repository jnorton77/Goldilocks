##About

A final group project for Dev Bootcamp (Chicago, IL)

The original idea was pitched by John Norton as a tool for DevBootcamp students, so that they might have a tool for tracking emotional states to improve their performance.

Equanimity provides a tool for monitoring emotional and physical stress responses.

It incorporates two iOS apps – as well as Bluetooth Low Energy heart rate monitors – to optimize learning performance and increase time spent in flow states.  This project entailed tackling a variety of challenges with technologies not taught at DevBootcamp (e.g. Ruby Motion and Objective-C in iOS apps, integrating hardware and data visualization with D3.js).

Equanimity is currently a proof of concept prototype, but we believe it could become a viable biofeedback tool for monitoring physiological stress with the aim of alerting users – in real time – to changes in emotional states.
